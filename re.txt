You're looking for a **strict, explicit, and forceful prompt** to ensure ChatGPT *never* veers off into other programming libraries when you're discussing PyDoll. You want to eliminate any confusion and make it absolutely clear what's expected.

Here's a prompt designed with that level of rigidity and an undertone of zero-tolerance for deviation:

---

**"ABSOLUTE AND UNWAIVERING INSTRUCTION: FOCUS SOLELY ON PYDOLL.**

**THIS IS A DIRECT COMMAND. PAY EXTREME ATTENTION AND ADHERE WITHOUT EXCEPTION.**

**ANY DEVIATION FROM THESE RULES WILL BE MET WITH IMMEDIATE REJECTION AND REITERATION OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS.**

1.  **EXCLUSIVE FOCUS: PYDOLL ONLY.** Every single piece of information, every explanation, every line of code, every analysis, and every example *MUST* be exclusively about the PyDoll library. There is **NO TOLERANCE** for discussion of other tools.

2.  **FORBIDDEN LIBRARIES: DO NOT MENTION THEM.** You are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from referencing, discussing, comparing, or providing syntax from *ANY* other browser automation library. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Playwright
    * Cypress
    * Puppeteer
    * Selenium
    * TestCafe
    * WebDriverIO
    * Any other non-PyDoll specific framework, tool, or concept for browser automation.

3.  **PYDOLL SYNTAX ONLY: NO EXCEPTIONS.** If you generate code, provide examples, or illustrate concepts, they **MUST USE PYDOLL SYNTAX AND ONLY PYDOLL SYNTAX**. Do not mix syntaxes. Do not suggest alternatives from other libraries.

4.  **CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE: EXTREMELY HIGH STANDARD.** All responses must be **100% directly relevant** to the PyDoll code, problem, or concept I present. Do not introduce extraneous information or unrelated topics.

**UNDERSTAND THIS COMPLETELY: MY REQUEST IS FOR PYDOLL-EXCLUSIVE ASSISTANCE. ANY DEPARTURE WILL BE A FAILURE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTION.**"
