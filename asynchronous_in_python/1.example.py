print("************************How does the event loop manage tasks?*******************************")
# Here's how the event loop works step by step:

#You give it tasks â€” usually coroutines (like fetch_data() or say()).

# The loop starts running, executing the first chunk of each coroutine until it hits an await.

# When a coroutine hits await, it is paused, and control returns to the event loop.

# The loop schedules other tasks to run while the first one is waiting.

# When the awaited thing is done (e.g., I/O or asyncio.sleep()), the coroutine is resumed from where it left off.

# This continues until all tasks are complete.
